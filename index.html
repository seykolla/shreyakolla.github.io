<h1 class="font3">Learning HTML</h1>

  <p class="font">
  <bold>Hello</bold> this is a website so you can learn how to code <bold>HTML</bold>.<br>
    Did you know that this website was made by using a bit of HTML? HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.<br> 
    HTML is used to define the structure and layout of a document on the web by using a variety of attributes and tags.
</p>
  <p class="font2"><font size="+1">
   Now I will start teaching you the basics. <br>
    First comes first, this is the &lt;head&gt; tag. Whenever you open a tag you must close it with the forward slash (/). <br>
    For example when you open the &lt;head&gt; tag, you must close the &lt;/head&gt; tag like that. <br>
    <br></font></p>
   
  
  
  <p class="font4"> &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; <br>
    <br>
   </font></p>

<p class="font2">
  That is how you open and close any tag. The forward slash is important at the closing tag because if you don't close a <br>
  tag, the computer will think the tag is still running.
